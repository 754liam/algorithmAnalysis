This program generates an array with 20 random integer elements. This array is then copied and passed to 4 different sorting algorithms, which then each sort the array from least to greatest. Each exchange within the sorting algorithm is logged in a counter variable. Once all arrays are sorted, this counter variable is returned through a method, and the amount of passes each sort made are outputted. This program is effective at demonstrating how different sorting algorithms have different time complexities, and if one wishes the size of the array can be shifted to test how time complexity shifts with n-size.
